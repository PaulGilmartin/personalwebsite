# What is this?
A personal website where I host some stuff about myself, my publications and some painting and photographs.

# Where?
www.paulgilmartin.co.uk

# What's the motivation?

1. To learn the basics of backend web development with Python. 
2. To have a place to display my c.v, publications and pictures

# How was it built?
In the backend, this website is built using the Python Flask library and flask SQL Alchemy extension. It was developed on a SQLLite database which
was upgraded to a MySQL databse when we pushed the website to production on an ubuntu server.
In the front end, we use Jinja2 for dynamic template rendering and CSS Bootstrap/Javascript for visuals.
